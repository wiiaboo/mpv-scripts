---------

Minesweeper clone. For when you watch something too boring.

Bring up with ctrl+x, then move with the cursor keys, and use space to
uncover tiles, or b to flag them.

Once you've won or lost, press space on an uncovered tile to restart.

t toggles transparent mode, if what you're watching is boring but not that boring.

w starts a new game and cycles through presets.

Bugs:

- weird scaling issues
- uses undocumented/private API and might thus break any time
